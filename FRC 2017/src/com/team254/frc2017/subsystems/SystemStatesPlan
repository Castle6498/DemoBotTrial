AYYYY LE PLAN

System Wanted States ------------------

Idle - turn off everything (set everything else to idle)

Unjam - set all systems to unjam state, if accumulator up, bring back down

Accumulate - bring down mechanism and flipping go, but don't overflow

Continuous_Shoot - just full blast feeder and shooter DONT CARE IF JAMMED

Manual_Shoot - Shoot and Idle, then have teleop Wait until it is done shooting



Shooter Subsystem - Linear Actuator and 3.3, no other sensors :D
                    Full stroke = shoot forward
                    Full retract = shoot straight up

                    Shoot Steps:
                    Speed up flywheel
                    Shoot
                    Don't really need a spin down feature
                    Doesn't really need a state machine, superstructure will take care of it
